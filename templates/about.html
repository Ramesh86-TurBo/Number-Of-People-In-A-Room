  <h3>Overview:</h3>
  <p>The "Number of People in a Room Classroom Monitoring System" is a web application that helps you keep track of how
    many people are present in a classroom or a room by using a video feed. The system detects faces in the video and
    shows you the real-time count of people. You can create a classroom, enter the IP address and port for the video
    feed, and see the live video along with the face count.</p>

  <h3>Tech Stack:</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Flask: Flask is a lightweight web framework written in Python. It is used to handle routing, rendering HTML
      templates, and managing the backend logic of the application.</li>
    <li>OpenCV: OpenCV (Open Source Computer Vision Library) is a popular library for computer vision tasks. In this
      project, OpenCV is used to process the video feed, detect faces in each frame, and calculate the count of people.
    </li>
    <li>HTML/CSS: HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) is used to structure the web pages, and CSS (Cascading Style Sheets)
      is used for styling and layout of the pages. HTML templates are rendered by Flask to display the different pages
      of the web application.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Code Overview:</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>Flask Setup: The project uses the Flask web framework to handle the backend logic and routing. It imports the
      necessary libraries and sets up the Flask application.</li>
    <li>HTML Templates: The project includes HTML templates for different pages like the home page, classroom creation
      page, about page, and the page displaying the video feed and face count. These templates define the structure and
      layout of the web pages.</li>
    <li>Video Processing: The detect_bounding_box function takes a video frame and performs face detection using OpenCV.
      It converts the frame to grayscale, applies a pre-trained face classifier, and draws bounding boxes around the
      detected faces. It also counts the number of people detected.</li>
    <li>Real-time Video Feed: The generate_frames function reads frames from the video feed and passes each frame to the
      detect_bounding_box function for processing. It then converts the processed frame to JPEG format and yields it as
      a response. This allows the video feed to be streamed in real-time to the web page.</li>
    <li>Web Routes: The Flask app defines several routes:
      <ul>
        <li>The home route (/) renders the index.html template for the home page.</li>
        <li>The /video_feed route takes the IP address of the video feed as a parameter and returns the video frames as
          a response.</li>
        <li>The /stop_feed route is called when the user wants to stop the video feed.</li>
        <li>The /count route is called via AJAX requests to get the latest face count.</li>
        <li>The /classroom route handles the creation of a classroom and displays the classroom creation form.</li>
        <li>The /about route renders the about.html template for the about page.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>JavaScript for Real-time Updates: The JavaScript code included in the HTML template is responsible for
      periodically sending AJAX requests to the server to get the latest face count. It updates the face count
      dynamically on the web page.</li>
  </ol>

  <h3>Faced Problems and Solutions:</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Problem: The `ip_address` variable in the `video_feed` route was getting a value of None.</li>
    <li>Solution: The HTML code was modified to include the IP address as a part of the URL when making a request to the
      `/video_feed` route. This ensured that the `ip_address` value was correctly received by the server.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Future Improvements:</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>User Authentication: Add a login system to make sure only authorized users can create classrooms and monitor
      them.</li>
    <li>Support Multiple Classrooms: Allow users to create and manage multiple classrooms simultaneously.</li>
    <li>Historical Data and Analytics: Store and analyze data about classroom occupancy over time. Provide reports and
      visualizations to understand usage patterns.</li>
    <li>Alerts and Notifications: Notify users when the number of people exceeds a limit or when unusual activity is
      detected.</li>
    <li>Improved Face Detection: Explore advanced face detection techniques for better accuracy and performance.</li>
    <li>Responsive Design: Make the web interface work well on different devices, like smartphones and tablets.</li>
    <li>Integration with Other Systems: Connect the classroom monitoring system with other systems or platforms, such as
      attendance management or home automation systems.</li>
  </ol>

  <p>By adding these improvements, the project can become more powerful, secure, and user-friendly. It will provide more
    features and an enhanced experience for users.</p>
